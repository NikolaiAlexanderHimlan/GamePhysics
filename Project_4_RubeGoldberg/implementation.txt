*"recommends against inheritance for rigid body from particle"

*okay to use friction code straight from the text

*"Your simulation loop uses elapsed seconds - this means that you have a variable frame-rate that can cause problems, as discussed in class. It is better to have a fixed physics time-step, and then spin through that time-step as many updates as necessary to reflect the change in wall-clock time."

*Allowed to use rigid body velocity resolution code directly from Cyclone

*(Bonus Quesion 5, from final exam) "If yes, recurse, if no, done".
