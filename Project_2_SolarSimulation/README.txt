Project: Solar System Simulation
Purpose: Demonstrate understand of and implement a Graphics framework as well as a gravity based physics system.

NOTE: I was unable to get the physics working properly so the planets fly off into the infinite void.

GLUI: I have included the GLUI libs for both debug and release (labeled), visual studio didn't like having a different name for the lib file.

Controls:
 (currently, input does not support pressing more than one key at a time) 
	- WASD standard FPS movement.
	- Arrow keys will rotate the pitch and yaw of the camera.
	- Pressing an number key will move the camera to the specified planet and lock the camera to that planet.
	- Press 'G' to unlock the camera from a planet's movement.

There is a GLUI window to the right when loading up the program which shows the position of the camera and the current target planet.  While there is no debug information in the simulation, and thus no need to toggle debug info on and off, the functionality to do so is available by unchecking the "Debug Ctrl" checkboxes.
